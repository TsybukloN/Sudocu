# Sudocu - Sudoku Puzzle Generator

## Overview

Sudocu is a desktop application using the Processing language. This application allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard) and choose from different puzzle sizes, including 6x6, 9x9, 10x10, and 14x14.

## Features
+ Sudoku puzzle generator.
+ Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
+ Puzzle sizes: 6x6, 9x9, 10x10, 14x14.
+ Time tooltip in the top-right corner displays the solving time.

## Usage
1. Download and install the application for your operating system (Windows and Linux are supported).
2. Launch the Sudocu application.
3. Choose the desired difficulty level and puzzle size.
4. Solve the Sudoku puzzle using the interactive interface.

## Algorithm Complexity
It is important to note that the algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles, especially for larger grid sizes like 10x10, falls into the category of NP-complete problems. The NP-completeness of the 10x10 Sudoku problem implies that finding a solution becomes significantly more challenging as the puzzle size increases.

### Application for Algorithm Development
**Sudocu can be used as a tool for developing and testing algorithms for solving** Sudoku puzzles. The application's flexibility in puzzle size and difficulty level makes it a valuable resource for algorithm development and analysis.
